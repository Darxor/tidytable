## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Converted the DESCRIPTION title to title case.

* Used single quotes to identify package names in the package description.

* Changed the package name due to a name conflict.

* Cleared all notes regarding globalVariables

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.1
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* This is a new release.

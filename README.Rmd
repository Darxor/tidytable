# gdt

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of gdt is to make {data.table} easier to use.

## Installation

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mtfairbanks/gdt")
```
## Example

The alias `let()` can be used to one or more columns:

```{r}
library(data.table)
library(gdt)
dt <- data.table(x = c(1,2,3), y = c(4,5,6))

dt[, let(double_x = x * 2,
         double_y = y * 2)][]
```

The alias `agg()` can be used for aggregations:

```{r}
dt <- data.table(x = c(1,2,3), y = c("a","a","b"))

dt[, agg(avg_x = mean(x)), by = y]
```
